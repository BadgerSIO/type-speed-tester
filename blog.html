              SessionStorage is similar to localStorage ; the difference is that
              while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage
              is cleared when the page session ends. Whenever a document is
              loaded in a particular tab in the browser, a unique page session
              gets created and assigned to that particular tab.

              What are the differences between global scope and block scope

            <p>
              Variables declared Globally (outside any function) have Global
              Scope. Global variables can be accessed from anywhere in a
              JavaScript program. Variables declared with var, let and const are
              quite similar when declared outside a block. They all have Global
              Scope. <br />On the other hand Variables declared within a
              JavaScript function, become LOCAL to the function.Since local
              variables are only recognized inside their functions, variables
              with the same name can be used in different functions. Local
              variables are created when a function starts, and deleted when the
              function is completed.

            <h3>How does javascrit event loop works?</h3>
            <img src="q3.jpg" alt="" srcset="" />
            <p>
              The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and
              the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop
              will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the
              Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called
              a tick in the Event Loop.

            <h3>How many ways we get undefined in javascript?</h3>
            <img src="q4.jpg" alt="" srcset="" />
            <p>
              You will get undefined value when you call a non-existent property
              or method of an object. A variable that has not been assigned a
              value is of type undefined. A method or statement also returns
              undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an
              assigned value. A function returns undefined if a value was not
              returned.
